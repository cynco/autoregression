# Predicting 5-year climate change in densely populated cities

I use autoregression on temperature data and stock and indexes data to produce 5-year climate forecasts that are sensitive to human impact such as regulations and adoption of environmentally sound practices and technologies. 

The data comes from the Berkely Earth page and stock data comes from the Yahoo Finance API.
